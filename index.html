          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a multitalented professional with expertise in frontend
            development and data entry. With a passion for creating visually
            appealing and user-friendly websites, I have developed skills in HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to design fully responsive web pages.
            My experience in frontend development allows me to craft clean,
            efficient, and modern UI designs while ensuring a seamless user
            experience.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            In addition to my web development skills, I have a strong background
            in data entry and administrative work. I have worked extensively with
            Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and other data management tools to
            ensure accuracy, efficiency, and organization in handling large
            volumes of data. My ability to manage records, process information
            quickly, and maintain high levels of precision has been an asset in
            various professional settings.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Furthermore, I have gained valuable industry experience working in the
            restaurant sector as well as A/C and refrigerator maintenance. My
            diverse skill set makes me adaptable to different roles, allowing me
            to contribute effectively in both technical and operational fields.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Currently, I am working as a Writer in the Pakistan Navy, where I
            handle official documentation, administrative tasks, and
            correspondence. This role has helped me develop strong communication,
            organizational, and technical writing skills.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my expertise
            in the IT field. With a keen interest in web development, data
            management, and technical writing, I am looking forward to new
            opportunities that challenge my abilities and allow me to grow
            professionally.
